<strong class="s_title">Building a 3D printed race car</strong>
After my freshman year of college, I was hired by IMEC, an international research comapny to work in Belgium for the summer. I had no idea what awaited me there, but it was fantastic. Given my experience with fabrication, I was sent to work with Formula Group T, working on their frist entry in the European Formula Student comeptitions - Aerion. Not only did I sharpen my welding and manufacturing skills I got to work with cutting edge technologies like biodegradeable composites to laser sintered titanium. My contributions included designing and fabricating a shipping container for the car to protect it en route to England and Germany, as well as advising in the manufacture and assembly of the vehicle.
