<strong class="s_title">Custom Laser Cut Speakers</strong>
For an introductory entreprenurship class, my team and I decided to build laser cut wood speakers, custom made to order. Our goal was to do highly technical, hands on work and bring a product to market before the semester ended. We only produced one finished set of speakers, but we learned a lot, and went through many iterations. <br/><br/>
I was in charge of the electrical design and manufacture, and worked on the audio amplifier. Through this experience I learned to use Eagle, how to route a board, and how frustrating surface mount soldering can be. At the end of the semester, however, I learned how truly game changing economies of scale are, and the barriers of entry to the portable audio market are high.
