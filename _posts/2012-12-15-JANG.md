<strong class="s_title">Custom Laser Cut Speakers</strong><br />
For an introductory entrepreneurship class, my team and I decided to build laser cut wood speakers, custom made to order. Our goal was to do highly technical, hands on work and bring a product to market before the semester ended. We only produced one finished set of speakers, but we learned a lot, and went through many iterations. 
<br /><br />
I was in charge of the electrical design and manufacture, and worked on the audio amplifier. Through this experience I learned to use Eagle, how to route a PCB, and how frustrating surface mount soldering can be. At the end of the semester, however, I learned how truly game changing economies of scale are, and the barriers of entry to the portable audio market are high. Not to mention dealing with lead times and syncing everything up for a product launch.
