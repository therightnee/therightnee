<strong class="s_title">REU at Virginia Tech</strong>
Traveling to the southwest reaches of Virginia, I spent a memorable summer at Virginia Tech, working with Dr. Saied Taheri as part of the Center for Tire Research. During my ten weeks with the program, my research focused on designing a testing platform for semi-active suspensions. Given my passion for cars and land vehicles it was a wonderful experience. In my spare time I would read class material on topics like vehicle dynamics and tire mechanics. While there wasn't enough time to build the rig, my partner, Jordan Ikeda, and I thoroughly reviewed the designs and gathered all the materials. In the Fall of 2013, the project continued as a senior design project, backed by General Motors. In addition, our research was selected by the Council for Undergraduate Research to be presented at their annual conference.
