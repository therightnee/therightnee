<strong class="s_title">JIMMY - Your 3D Printed Friend</strong>
Intel approached our Mechanical Design class, ENGR3330, with an interesting proposition. Design, and potentially build, a robot made from completely 3D printed parts. The intent of this project was to develop an affordable platform that would allow high school and college students the ability to use and interact bipedal robots in their studies, without breaking the bank. Intel provided the artistic inspiration, and our job was to design the linkages, drive mechanisms, and structures to make it happen. From this experience I gained a lot more experience in working with a large design team, getting creative with fasteners, and thinking through the user experience when assembling the robot.
