<strong class="s_title">Quieting a Loud Bicycle.</strong><br />
In the spring of 2015 I took on a contract job while finishing up my degree. It was an exhilarating feeling bringing in some money, while at the same time helping to benefit others with the skillset I had worked so hard to acquire over the last four years. The product was a car horn that would be strapped onto a bicycle so that bicyclists could alert drivers to their presence. Having been studying roads and the many dangers that exist for bicyclists, pedestrians and other non-vehicular users, I knew the need was real and that this product was attempting to solve a critical problem. The issue I was brought on to address was the testing portion of the manufacturing line. The horns were capable of outputting 120 dB, a necessary loudness if you want to catch the attention of a driver, but potentially damaging to a worker trying to do some quality assurance. To address this issue, I was tasked to create a flat-pack jig that would seat a pair of earmuffs that would allow the tester to quickly insert, test, and remove the horn. This would be much cheaper than buying earmuffs for the whole factory floor. I went through several iterations with the client, evolving the simple design I started with to address the various stakeholder values - the easy to ship and low cost requirements set forth by the client, and the ergonomic and time efficient process desired by the user who would be testing the horns. Looking back I see this job as a set of training wheels to my budding career. The impact was real, the requirements were not simulated or given to me, and the reward was tangible.
